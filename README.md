# Infrastructure Proposals Repository

Welcome to the **DPSN Infrastructure Proposals Repository**! This repository serves as a collaborative space where community members can submit, discuss, and propose infrastructure solutions. We are in the early stages of structuring the repository, and we welcome contributions from everyone interested in shaping the future of decentralized infrastructure.

## üìå How It Works

1. **Submit Proposals:** Community members can add new proposals by submitting a pull request to this repository or by reaching out to @jainsanil18.
2. **Contribute Solutions:** Anyone can provide a solution to existing proposals by submitting their implementation or suggesting modifications.
3. **Discussion & Feedback:** Discussions and feedback are encouraged through GitHub issues or by emailing **sanil@dpsn.org**.
4. **Incentives & Rewards:** Depending on the project and agreement between teams, contributors may receive either **points** or **monetary rewards (in dollars)** for their accepted proposals.
